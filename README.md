Let <em>R </em>be a ring with identity 1 <em>6</em>= 0<em>.</em>

<strong>7.4.19 </strong>Let <em>R </em>be a finite commutative ring with identity. Prove that every prime ideal of R is a maximal ideal.

<strong>7.5.3 </strong>Let <em>F </em>be a field. Prove that <em>F </em>contains a unique smallest subfield <em>F</em><sub>0 </sub>and that <em>F</em><sub>0 </sub>is isomorphic to either Q or Z/<em>p</em>Z for some prime <em>p </em>(<em>F</em><sub>0 </sub>is called the <em>prime subfield </em>of <em>F</em>).

[See Exercise 26, Section 3.]

<strong>8.2.2 </strong>Prove that any two nonzero elements of a P.I.D. have a least common multiple (cf. Exercise 11, Section 1).

<strong>8.2.3 </strong>Prove that a quotient of a P.I.D. by a prime ideal is again a P.I.D.

<strong>9.1.4 </strong>Prove that the ideals (<em>x</em>) and (<em>x,y</em>) are prime ideals in Q[<em>x,y</em>], but only the latter ideal is a maximal ideal.
